## So tell me about yourself.(Interview first impression)

My name is Angel Sanchez, I am a Full Stack Java Developer, and I graduated Union County College with an Associate's Degree in Computer Science. As a college student and working in the manufacturing industry before Revature, I learned the core values of team collaboration and the ability to work under pressure to meet strict deadlines.

During Revature's 10-week program, I practiced many technologies and completed four separate projects utilizing these technologies. For instance, I created a Pokemon Store which used `JUnit Testing`, `Java`, `Postgres SQL`, `JDBC`, and `AWS RDS`. Users were able to register and view the store's inventory, including their own, as well as create offers for a Pokemon. Employees were able to create and delete Pokemon, approve or deny offers, and delete customer accounts. -- MAYBE MENTION IDE USED --

Furthermore, I created an Employee Reimbursement System Full Stack application where I had utilized the same and new technologies such as `Web pages`, `HTTP Servlets`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `TomCat server`, and `Hibernate`. Employees were able to create a reimbursement ticket and set the type of ticket and their amount, register an account, login, and view their reimbursement status. Managers were able to do similar functions as Employees but can also approve or deny reimbursement tickets, view and edit all customer accounts, and view all past reimbursement tickets.

-- IF NEEDED, DON'T MENTION -- In addition, my third project was the first time I worked with a team on developing a Full Stack application. Together, we created an Art Social Media Website that allowed users to register an account, login, edit their account information, extract Art pieces from Chicago's Institute of Art API, and showcase their favorite art piece to their user profile. Administrators were able to do the same functions as a basic user, but can also remove other user accounts. My team and I took an AGILE approach and our Scrum master would utilize Git Hub to organize each other's tasks. We also practiced new technologies such as `Angular` Framework, `Spring` for our Back End Development, and `Bootstrap` to style the web page. -- IF NEEDED, DON"T MENTION --

Finally, for my final and most recent project, I worked in a successful team of 18 and we were tasked to build a full stack Social Media website of the daily life for Revature Associates.  With an AGILE approach, we were broken down into smaller teams to focus on separate tasks, my team of 6 were focused on the user being able to edit their personal account information and upload a profile picture. We utilized prior technologies such as `Angular`, `Spring`, `Bootstrap`, and `HTTP Servlets` for a dynamic user experience. 

To sum up, Revature has taught me a greater value in teamwork and initiative with coding teams and strict deadlines. I appreciate the opportunities that have presented to me and I look forward to developing projects with *CITI Bank*(Company Name).

## Best Strength
My best strength is perserverance. I am a hard worker and I am always willing to work hard to complete a task. DEADLINE: I had to put in extra hours to meet the deadline and communicated with other teammates to meet up and work together on our solo project. *Include project2/bday weekend example*.  

## Why should we hire you?
You should hire me because I am eager to learn new technologies and willingness to grow not only as a person but also as a Software Developer in a successful company. I am a hard worker and I am always willing to work hard to complete a task. 

## What are you passionate about?
Expanding my knowledge in the technology field in the most beneficial way. After I built my first computer, I wanted to learn how to develop software and work with successful teams in a big company. I am passionate about technology and I am looking forward to working with a company that values technology and innovation.
