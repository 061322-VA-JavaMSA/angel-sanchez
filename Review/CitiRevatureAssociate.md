## Moving process
- If required to move, should be given within 2 - 4 week timeline.

## Daily work at CITI Bank
- Start with Daily standups with team members. Check emails for any additional tickets/exercises. After that, begin coding on project and task that was assigned.

## First week
- Just introducing yourself and downloading the required CITI Bank software and programs. Training on these software/programs is available. Just getting set up essentially.

## First month
- When assigned a massive project, with hundreds to thousands of packages/classes, you pick what they give you. For example, CITI Bank offered past Recature associates, "Would you like to work on UI or Service?". This means you pick what feature you want to work on and get assigned to a team. EXPECT TO START WORK FOR CITI. Could be working with teams from different countries. Everyone is willing to help, don't be afraid to ask questions. 

## What important material that helped from Revature?
- Java, JUnit, testing, Angular, HTTP, and SQL.
