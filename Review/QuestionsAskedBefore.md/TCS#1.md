### Question 1
> Conceptual Based Questions:
- How would a "person" object be accessed and stored in Angular/Java?
The person object can be accesses by referencing their name. For example, a person class can have attributes/fields such as age, gender, etc. Any code outside of the person class must reference the object/person and a (.) operator followed by the field name. 
```
public static void main(String[]args){
    public class Person{
        static int age;
        static String gender;

        System.out.println("Person's age: " + p.addAge())
    }
    public class addAge(Person p){
        int age = new p().age;
        age.add(40);
    }
}
```
