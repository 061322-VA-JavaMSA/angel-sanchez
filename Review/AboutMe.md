## So tell me about yourself.(Interview first impression)

My name is Angel Sanchez, a Full Stack Java Developer, and I am the first in my immediate family to graduate college with an Associate's in Computer Science. During my time as a Union County College student and working in the manufacturing industry prior to Revature, I learned the core values of working well with a team and the ability to work under pressure to meet strict deadlines. After my school career, I knew that I wanted to pursue my career in the technology industry, which is how I found Revature.

During Revature's 10-week training program, I learned practiced many technologies. I had to work on four separate projects utilizing new tecnologies every two weeks. For instance, for my first project, I utilized JUnit, Java, Postgres SQL, and AWS RDS where I built a simple E-commerce store and since I enjoy playing video games, I sold Pokemon as my store items. Customers in my first project were able to register and view the store's inventory, including their own, as well as create item offers. Employees were able to create and delete store items, approve or deny offers, and delete customer accounts.

My second project was an Employee Reimbursement System full stack application where I had to utilize new technologies such as Web pages and HTTP Servlets. On top of using Java and Postgres SQL, I practiced new *languages* such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for users to experience a dynamic web environment. Employees are able to register, login, and view their account or reimbursement status. Furthermore, they can create a reimbursement ticket to their specific need such as Lodging, Food, Travel, or Other with a specific dollar amount. Managers were able to do similar functions as Employees but can also approve or deny reimbursement tickets, view and edit all customer accounts, and view all past reimbursement tickets.

My third project was special since it was the first time I worked with a team on developing a full stack application. Our team of 6 built an Art Social Media Website that allowed users to login, edit their account information, search from Chicago's Institute of Art API, and showcase their favorite art piece to their profile. Furthermore, application Administrators were able to do the same functions as a basic user, but can also remove other user accounts. My team and I used an AGILE approach and our Scrum master would utilize Git Hub to organize each other's tasks. We utilized new technologies such as Angular for our web page development, Spring for our IDE, and Bootstrap to style the web page.

For my final project and most recent, I worked in a successful team of 18 and we were tasked to build a full stack Social Media website of the daily life for Revature Associates. Users are able to create a blog post, follow other users, edit their account, view other user profiles, and insert a professional URL in their profile. With an AGILE approach, we were broken down into smaller teams to focus on separate tasks, my team of 6 were focused on the user being able to edit their personal account information and upload a profile picture. We utilized prior technologies such as Angular, Spring, Bootstrap, and HTTP Servlets for a dynamic user experience. 

To sum up, Revature has taught me a greater value in teamwork and initiative with coding teams and strict deadlines. I appreciate the opportunities that have presented to me and I look forward to developing projects with *CITI Bank*(Company Name).
